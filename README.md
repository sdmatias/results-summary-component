## My process

As in my previous challenge, the first step was to write the HTML semantics, followed by the corresponding links to the external stylesheet and google-fonts in the head section of index.html.
Once this was done I continued with the writing of the CSS code, using flexbox to place everything in its respective place.
Through a media query make the design responsive for smaller screens.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge made me investigate variable fonts in CSS, although I did not use them in this case, I find myself internalizing this topic.
I also investigated the files with the .json ending since it's the first time I've seen them
These files are not included in my solution as I don't know how to use them yet.

### Continued development

I want to continue practicing responsive design as I don't feel completely comfortable with my code in that regard, it took me longer than I expected.
Once I feel more comfortable writing HTML and CSS my next step will be to start learning JavaScript.
